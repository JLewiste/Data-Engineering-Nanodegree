# data-engineering-nanodegree
Solution to all projects of Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree: Data Modeling with Postgres &amp; Cassandra, Data Warehouse with Redshift, Data Lake with Spark and Data Pipeline with Airflow.

## Projects

### Data Modeling
Learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

[Data modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/JLewiste/data-engineering-nanodegree/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Data%20Modeling%20with%20Apache%20Cassandra)

### Cloud Data Warehouses
Sharpen your data warehousing skills and deepen your understanding of data infrastructure. Create cloud-based data warehouses on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
